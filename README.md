# spa-angular4-v2
##### Notes:

The structure of project:
Code of [client] is the front end implemented with *Angular 4* framework
Code of [public] is the front end implemented with *AngularJS* framework
Code of [src] is the backend API implemented with ExpressJS.

How to run:
1. In terminal, go to the root folder of project, run `npm run-script db` to initialize the database
2. Then run `npm start` to start the ExpressJS first.
3. Open your browser and content `http://localhost:5000`. This will lead you to the AngularJS pages.
4. Open another Terminal window and run `npm run-script ngrun`, this will start the Angular 4 application.

Both application acts in the same way through different in the back.  :metal:
